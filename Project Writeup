*What is the question you hope to answer?

Can I predict the type of product complaint based on the percentages of Income, Born in State of Residence, Foreign Born, and Poverty Status of a given Zipcode/ZCTA?

*What data are you planning to use to answer that question?

Since this project is based off an existing skills assessment test, the datasets instructions that were provided are the following:

For this exercise you are to build a script or program based in the following instructions:

  1.    Download CFPBâ€™s public complaint database (http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaintdatabase/)

  2.    Download income data from the 5-year ACS survey file from census.gov (http://www2.census.gov/acs2013_5yr/summaryfile/2009-2013_ACSSF_By_State_By_Sequence_Table_Subset/UnitedStates/All_Geographies_Not_Tracts_Block_Groups/20135us0015000.zip) 

  The header information for the sequence file can be found in the Seq15.xls file in the zip file located here:  http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/summary_file/2013/data/2013_5yr_Summary_FileTemplates.zip.
  3. Download geography information for the 5-year ACS survey file from census.gov (http://www2.census.gov/acs2013_5yr/summaryfile/2009-2013_ACSSF_By_State_By_Sequence_Table_Subset/UnitedStates/All_Geographies_Not_Tracts_Block_Groups/g20135us.csv)

  The header information for the geography file can be found on page 10 of the technical document here:  http://www2.census.gov/acs2013_5yr/summaryfile/ACS_2013_SF_Tech_Doc.pdf

*What do you know about the data so far?

What I know about the data so far is that the types of complaints can be granualar if needed, but there is definitely a lot more fields than needed.  The headers for the data are in different formats for the various files.

*Why did you choose this topic?

This topic is based upon a skills assessment that I was given when applying to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  At the time I was trying to teach myself Python on the fly while taking the assessment, so I did not complete it.  However, I hope to be able to accomplish the tesk utilizing the skills I learn in this class.
